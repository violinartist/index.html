                    Hello, my name is Paul-Minho Gil. I'm a musical Artist. 
                    <br>I have one brother who is the exact same age as me. 
                    <br>I have two little sisters who are also the same age as each other. 
                    <br>As you know, I love classical music. I hate rap, heavy metal, rock, and other 
                    <br>songs that are in the pop collection. I'm a fan of Mozart and Bach. 
                    <br>I play the violin and compose music as well. I usually like rainy or 
                    <br>snowy days the most. Mostly, rain. It helps me concentrate on 
                    <br>classwork, school work, and homework. 
                    <br>And yes, I go to school.
                    <br>
                    <br>I'll be posting more blogs in the future. So stay tuned for that!
                    <br>
                    <br>
